### Definition: 
Typography is the art and technique of arranging type to make written language legible, readable and appealing when displayed.

### Importance of Typography

* A good typography attract the readers
* It reflects professionalism
* It adds great value to your brand

If a good typography holds such an important place in designing then we as designers should be well aware about using them effectively.

**Here are some typography tips which you can keep in mind while designing your next project:**

* Make sure that the text is readable.

There are many ways through which you can improve the readability and one of them is proper contrast. In FIGMA there is a plugin name ‘Stark’ which can be used to check contrast

* Text line length should not be too long.

A good rule is not to exceed 90 characters in a single line. ‘Count Text’ in Adobe XD and ‘Text Counts’ in FIGMA can be used to count words and characters in a text layer.

* Use readable font size.

The body and paragraph text is recommended to be 16–17 points while heading should be around 1.96 times larger than body text. Its also a good practice to scale your large headings while shifting to a smaller screen.

* Choose one typeface in order to create uniformity

There are 4 types of typefaces — Serifs, Sans Serifs, Scripts and Decorative. Try to avoid mixing typefaces but if you still want to continue, mix from the same super family.

* Balance line spacing

Line spacing is the vertical distance between lines. For screen design, a reasonable size will be between 14–25 pixels depending on the typeface you choose. It will be relative to your body text size.

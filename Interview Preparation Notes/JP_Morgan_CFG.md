# JP Morgan CFG Experience

JP Morgan came to our campus in the month of March with its Code For Good 2022 event.

## Eligibility Criteria

* Degrees: B.Tech./B.E./MCA
* 2023 Batch Pass-outs [eligible for Full-Time opportunity]
* 2024 Batch Pass-outs [eligible for Internship opportunity]

## Round 1: Coding Assessment

It was an online assessment held on hackerrank platform which had 2 coding questions. Time given for the same was 60 minutes. The level of the questions asked was easy to medium and a basic knowledge of Data Structures and Algorithm would help you qualify this round.

## Round 2: HireVue Interview

After you clear the coding assessment, you get a mail for HireVue interview. In this round, 2 behavioral questions are popped on the screen and you have to record your answers for the same at that particular time itself. You get 2 attempts for the same. 2nd attempt is optional but if you choose to take that, it will automatically be submitted.

## Round 3: The Hackathon

This round makes the hiring process a lot more fun. The fact that you won’t be judged on a 40–60 min interview but on the whole performance of 24 hours makes it even more fair and interesting. In may, our placement cell released the the list of students qualifying for Code for Good and the dates for hackathon were 4–5 June, 2022.

The best part of this hackathon was that was very beginner friendly. They rolled out a survey form before making the teams so that each team has a variety of skills. Apart from this, they also conducted 3 workshops before the event to make everyone comfortable with the culture.

* GitHub Best Practices and Tips
* QnA Session
* How to pitch for your final presentations

Just a day before the hackathon we were informed about our respective teams and mentors. Its important that you have a conversation with your team and mentors beforehand so that you become comfortable with them and won’t hesitate to ask help later. The hackathon started with an opening ceremony followed by NGOs displaying and explaining their problem statement. Later a form was provided to fill in your preference for the NGOs. For next 24 hours we were expected to come up with a solution for the problem statement of the NGO assigned to us. The whole of the event was very much fun. We learnt a lot in the process and made amazing friends. Coming up with a fully implemented solution in one night itself is an achievement.

This hackathon is further concluded with a 7 minute presentation. To get an offer, its not compulsory to win the hackathon but to perform your best. The mentors assigned you are not judging on what you already know but how you perform with strict deadlines, how fast you learn something in which you are not much comfortable and how good is your adaptive power.

### Tips for hackathon:

* Bond well with your teammates.
* Be very vocal about your ideas.
* Time management is the key for performing in this hackathon. Make sure you divide your work among your teammates in such a way that you get ample time for the presentation video.
* In the later July came the results and I was glad to secure an offer from JP Morgan.

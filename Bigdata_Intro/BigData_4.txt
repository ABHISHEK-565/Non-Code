Some of the HDFS Demos:

1. Create a directory in HDFS?
=> hadoop fs -mkdir dir_name

2. To list the files in HDFS?
=> hadoop fs -ls

3. To put file from UNIX file system to HDFS?
-> hadoop fs -put file_name dir_name

4. To view the contents of file in HDFS?
=> hadoop fs -cat dir_name/file_name

5. To transfer file from HDFS to UNIX?
=> hadoop fs -get dir_name/file_name new_filename

6. To remove directory from HDFS?
=> hadoop fs -rmdir dir_name

7. To remove file from HDFS?
=> hadoop fs -rm file_name

(These are some of the basic commands)
(Most of the command are same as that of UNIX commands)

Introduction to MapReduce Framework:

MapReduce:
MapReduce is a software framework for writing distributed applications.
Processing data is done in parallel in the cluster.

MapReduce breaks the entire computation into two phases:
1. Map Phase: Execution happens at node level.
2. Reduce Phase: All the output of map phase is aggregated together.

Map Phase: Execution happens at node level. In a cluster, all the nodes containing the data would be processed in parallel at the same time

Reduce Phase: All the output of the Map Phase will be aggregated together and the final output will be in 'key-value'format.

Note: Map Reduce programs are mostly written in Java, Python etc.



These were very basic info about BigData. 
Bigdata is far more vast.
It also consists of Spark,Pyspark etc.
